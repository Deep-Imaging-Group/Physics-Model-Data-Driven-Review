# Synergizing-Physics-Model-based-and-Data-driven-Methods-for-Low-Dose-CT

This is the codes for the physics/model data-driven methods for low-dose CT. They are reproduced by us based on the content of these papers. If you think there is something wrong with the code, please contact us.


Before using this code, please install our library for CT reconstruction:

https://github.com/xwj01/CTLIB

Then type:
